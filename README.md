A list of awesome articles and resources to learn about event-driven architecture. Please note that the list is **highly curated**. The aspiration is to assemble those resources that the curator fully endorses and recommends, not as many as possible. In the spirit of the [Awesome Lists Guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/pull_request_template.md): _"Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything."_


Of course if you think something awesome is missing from the list, you can suggest its inclusion by creating a PR.
